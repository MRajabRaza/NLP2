                    <strong>What is natural language processing with example?</strong> Natural language processing (NLP)
                    is an interdisciplinary subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence
                    concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program
                    computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer
                    capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the
                    language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained
                    in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

                    Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language
                    understanding, and natural-language generation.

                    </code>, Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing
                    published an article titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which proposed what is now called
                    the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a
                    problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the
                    automated interpretation and generation of natural language..

                    <strong>Symbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s).</strong> The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized
                    by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook,
                    with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other
                    NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954
                    involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors
                    claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.[1] However,
                    real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long
                    research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically
                    reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some
                    research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe[2]) until the late 1980s when the first
                    statistical machine translation systems were developed.

                    <strong>Neural NLP (present).</strong> In 2003, Yoshua Bengio with co-authors tried to use a
                    multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up
                    to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling and overperformed the best of n-gram
                    models (a typical statistical alogrithm) then available.[7] In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD
                    student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network
                    with a single hidden layer to language modelling,[8] and in the following years he went on to
                    develop Word2vec.

                    In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers)
                    machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due
                    partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[9][10] can achieve state-of-the-art
                    results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[11] and parsing.[12][13] This is
                    increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in
                    electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve
                    care[14] or protect patient privacy.[15].

            <hr>
            <p>Further information: Artificial neural network
                A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since
                2015,[22] the field has thus largely abandoned statistical methods and shifted to neural networks for
                machine learning. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties
                of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering)
                instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and
                dependency parsing).
                <br>
                <br>
                In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are
                designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from
                statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT)
                emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn
                sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment
                and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation (SMT)...

            <p>The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.
                Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks
                that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.

                Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories
                for convenience. A coarse division is given below..</p>
